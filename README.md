# Ricochet: Source 2
 WIP project that aims to port Ricochet into S&Box. The plan is to make the game identical to the original, or at least as close as possible given the API and tools available. I started this project mainly to experiment with S&Box before I move onto more complex projects, so any changes that greatly differ from the original game are not planned. Credit goes to Valve for the original game and its resources.
